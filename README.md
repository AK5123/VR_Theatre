# VR_Theatre
VR React360 app that suggests and connects like-minded peers in order to enjoy the movie
and create new connections with strangers. Built a user-user collaborative filtering
recommendation model   in  order  to sort the most similar interest users and connect them.
Used peer-to-peer connection to chat and share the pause/play/seek functions of the video player.
